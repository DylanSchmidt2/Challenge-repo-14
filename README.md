## Thoughts
Working on these Heroku apps still kick my butt. I was able to get this named and posted to a Heroku app and ended up breaking my code. Writing the models and routes for users and posts are very nice for configuring custom settings and restraints. I have also found the handlebars language to be extremely transferable and comparable to HTML which has been nice. I've gotten a lot of help putting this together and getting closer to an MVP hopefully.
