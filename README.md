### Bugs

### Extra add-ons
###### I enjoy adding quality of life (qol) functions to assignments, time permitting. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to bring them to life on this assignment.
* Automatic list templates (Numbering 1, 2, 3, 4... )
* Date/Time stamps
* 'Preview' cards for each note to see a snippit of what it contains.

### Final thoughts
This application showcases how simple it is to utilize things like _Node_ and _express_ to create a server and be able to perform CRUD actions. Express is a very usefull Node function. I haven't fully grasped it's useages, I'm currently trying to learn MySQL. 

###### Biggest struggle 
By far learning and using Heroku, I'm not sure where to even start. I've gotten progressivly better with it but still behind. I can't stress enough how much fundational knowlege helps while learning new node modules and thier proper usages.

###### Extra-info
You might notice some extra _commits_ in the log. I was forced to delete a existing project out of this repo because I entered incorrect links in my submission.
